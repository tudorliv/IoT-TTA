Authors: Liviana N. Tudor, Lecia Barker, Mohammad Q. Azhar, Jorge Guerra, Clark Mousaw

The IoT-TTA is a semantic ontology of terms related to the Internet of Things technologies, tools, and applications that has capabilities of interoperability, data preprocessing, and fast querying. The IoT-TTA ontology ensures interoperability through the Flow-Service-Quality semantics based on constraints and semantic queries based on statistical formulas.

Ontology description is carried out by setting the vocabulary of terms related to enterprise and industrial IoT layers and defining the parent/child relationships based on IoT concepts, technologies, and tools. The figure below gives an overview of the taxonomic objects hierarchy for IoT systems.
