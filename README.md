Abstract
===========

The IoT-TTA is a semantic ontology of terms related to the Internet of Things technologies, tools, and applications that has capabilities of interoperability, data preprocessing, and fast querying. The IoT-TTA ontology ensures interoperability through the Flow-Service-Quality semantics based on constraints and semantic queries based on statistical formulas.

Introduction
===========

Ontology description is carried out by setting the vocabulary of terms related to enterprise and industrial IoT layers and defining the parent/child relationships based on IoT concepts, technologies, and tools. We will extend the IoT taxonomy with semantic ontologies containing a knowledge base with properties and rules specific to IIoT layers, technologies, tools, applications, and relationships between them.

Semantic ontology for IoT layers
===========

- Device layer ontology

- Support layer ontology
- Ontology for IIoT applications based on cloud and edge computing
